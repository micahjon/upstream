				<h2>Unlock your data</h2>
				<p>Everyday you have things you need to monitor whether it’s internal metrics, sensor readings, supplier data, or anything else. With Upstream, you can capture all those data streams in one location, automate monitoring, and easily share the results; all in real time. Instead of batch monitoring them all throughout your busy day, save time rest easy knowing that Upstream is handling the monitoring for you.</p>
				<h2>Visualize your data:</h2>
				<p>Your stream comes into Upstream and immediately updates any visualizations you have set up. No need to wait for processing or even refresh the chart. And if a friend, coworker, or supervisor, needs access to the information, share it with them! Or even share it to the public at large! They’ll have the same real-time knowledge that you do.</p>

				<h2>Open the valve:</h2>
				<p>Create a new stream, define the fields, and start pushing data through a webhook. </p>
				<h2>Build your pipeline:</h2>
				<p>Filter, group, and aggregate in real time! Adding transforms is pretty simple, and you can stack and combine them to get the data you want. For example, you can filter out extraneous events, group the data by location, and then average each location. We don’t make any assumptions about your data so you can define what you want to happen. 
				</p>
				<h2>The human connection:</h2>
				<p>In order to make the data more approachable, we provide tools to visualize the data. Create a visualization that makes sense for your events. And then watch them update in real time as events stream through. You can also create triggers for events, firing off an email for events that are out of range, or using a webhook to integrate with another system.
