		<p>Upstream is a new service for building stream pipelines. Whether you are tracking device heartbeats, service metrics, manufacturing line outputs, river quality, or outputs from any other changing environment, we provide a simple set of building blocks that you can use to massage, monitor, or publish event streams. And getting started should only take a few minutes.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Create your stream</h2>
		<p>Just <a href="{{ site.links.signup }}">sign up</a> with an email or a Google account, create a channel, and start firing POST requests.</p>
		
		<pre class="code"><code>$ curl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{"cpu":".23","memory":".13","load":"4"}'
  https://api.upstreamapp.io/hook/YOUR_SECRET_KEY</code></pre>

  		<p>Even if you donâ€™t have your own data sources, you can subscribe to channels that others have created. Or view public channels with no account required.</p>

  		<br>
  		<h2>Transform, Filter and Aggregate</h2>
  		<p>Apply a diverse set of transformations to your events. Filter on one or more conditions, calculate grouped aggregates, or execute custom formulas&mdash;all updated in real time.</p>

  		<p>To help keep people in the loop, you can visualize your events using several different live updating graphs and tables.</p>

  		<figure class="chart">
  			<div class="chart__aspect-ratio">
  				<iframe class="chart__iframe" scrolling='no' frameBorder='0' title="Upstream embedded cart demo" src='https://embed.upstreamapp.io/?profile=lucasmg&channel=upstream-monitor&visual=CPU History'></iframe>
  			</div>
  		</figure>
  		
  		<p>For private channels, you can also create external triggers, such as email alerts for out of control processes or calling webhooks to integrate with other systems.</p>

  		<p><a href="{{ site.links.signup }}" class="btn btn-primary">Try it out</a></p>
  		
  		<br>
  		<h2>Publish-Subscribe</h2>
  		<p>Upstream was built to make sharing streams of data with others a cinch. You can make as many public channels as you like, allowing anyone to see your visuals or even fork the channel for themselves.</p>
  		<p>If you want to keep streams to yourself, make them private and give fine-grain access to other users.</p>

  		<br>
		<h2>Join the beta!</h2>
		<p>Upstream is getting started, <strong>we are constantly improving and value your feedback</strong>. Making an account with unlimited public channels is free (and always will be), but you can also make one private channel when you signup during the beta. In the future, we also plan on offering more private channels with pricing options.</p>
